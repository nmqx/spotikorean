## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

1. Open `spotikorean.py`.

   ```

## üöÄ Usage

```bash
python spotikorean.py
```

1. **Output folder prompt**  
   - You‚Äôll be asked to **‚ÄúSpecify output folder‚Äù** (default: `~/Music`).  
2. **Search prompt**  
   - Enter a **song name**, **keywords**, or a **full Spotify URL**.  
3. **Download & Tag**  
   - The script uses `yt-dlp` to search YouTube and download the best audio as MP3.  
   - It then queries Spotify to find the matching track (or uses your provided link), extracts metadata (title, artist(s), album, release date, track number, genre, cover art), and writes ID3 tags into the MP3 via `mutagen`.  
4. **Exit**  
   - Press **ESC** at any time to quit the program gracefully.

All downloaded and tagged files will appear in your chosen folder.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- **ffmpeg not found**: Ensure `ffmpeg` binaries are in your system `PATH`.  
- **Keyboard listener issues**: On some systems, `keyboard` requires elevated privileges. Run the script as administrator/root or remove the ESC-check loop if unnecessary.  
- **No results found**: Check your search terms or try a direct Spotify URL.
